# GameIdeas
An app where different departments at HW compete for high scores in minigames.
    - Students who join/make an account would be randomly assigned a dept and teachers would be overridden to be a part of the dept they actually are in
    - There could be academic games (but that's lowk lame)
    - Prolly like paper airplane game (like paper toss but with airplanes) and scores based on most airplanes into a bucket
    -Teachers would log points of their classes and each teacher would add those points to the total department points
    -We could also implement chess into this. Users could play chess to gain points for their own department
    -Winners would receive prizes every certain amount of time interval
    -People get addicted to short minigames
    -There will be a main page with a set of buttons to different minigames

-While this is a very HW centralized game, eventually we could get rid of that aspect and just have broader teams
    -This would allow for a wider range of users from different places that could participate in the games and competitions
