# GameIdeas
An app where different departments at HW compete for high scores in minigames.
    - Students who join/make an account would be randomly assigned a dept and teachers would be overridden to be a part of the dept they actually are in
    - There could be academic games (but that's lowk lame as)
    - Prolly like paper airplane game (like paper toss but with airplanes) and scores based on most airplanes into a bucket
