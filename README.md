# Campus Challenge Application Design

## Introduction

### Overview
The "Campus Challenge" application is an engaging platform designed to promote healthy competition among students at HW. It is specifically tailored for the HW community, with the potential for broader use in the future. The primary goal of the application is to foster a sense of camaraderie and excitement within different academic departments at HW by offering a variety of mini-games and challenges.

### Target Audience
The application is primarily aimed at students and teachers at HW. Students will be the primary participants, while teachers play a crucial role in overseeing and contributing to department scores. As the platform evolves, it has the potential to extend its reach to a wider range of users from different educational institutions.

## Value/Use

### Fostering Departmental Unity
"Campus Challenge" serves as a tool for strengthening the sense of belonging and unity within academic departments. By creating a shared competitive space, it encourages students to work together, bond, and identify more strongly with their respective departments.

## User Interaction and Experience

### Seamless Navigation
Users can easily navigate the application through a user-friendly main page featuring buttons for different mini-games. The interface is designed for simplicity and accessibility, ensuring that users of all backgrounds can enjoy a smooth and intuitive experience.

The application offers a diverse range of mini-games, from casual games like the paper airplane toss to intellectual challenges like chess. This variety caters to different interests and skill levels, enhancing the user experience.

## Competitive Element

### Departmental Scores
The core of the competition lies in departmental scores. Students are randomly assigned to a department, and teachers are aligned with their actual departments. Teachers log points earned by their classes in various mini-games, and these points contribute to the total score of the department.

### Prizes for Winners
To boost motivation and participation, winners are rewarded with prizes at regular intervals. This competitive element adds an extra layer of excitement to the experience.

## Engagement and Addictiveness Strategies

### Short Mini-Games
The inclusion of short mini-games capitalizes on people's tendency to become addicted to quick challenges. These games are easy to pick up and play, making them ideal for short breaks or moments of leisure.

While initially designed for the HW community, "Campus Challenge" has the potential to expand its user base to other educational institutions. The platform's flexible architecture allows for scalability and adaptation to different contexts and user demographics.

### Non-Discrimination Clause
The application adheres to the California non-discrimination clause, ensuring that it is inclusive and welcoming to all users, regardless of their background, race, gender, or abilities.
